// Allocator Interface
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The Allocator interface.
//
// * Allocators are instance based and can therefore be decided at runtime.
// * Typically classes should not own or create allocators, only keep simple pointers (Allocator*).
// * Typically allocator pointers should be moved/copied when a class is moved/copied.
// * Typically equality operators (==, !=) should ignore allocator pointers.
// * It is the responsibility of the creator of the allocator instance to ensure that all users
//   that have been provided a pointer have freed all their memory and are done using the allocator
//   before the allocator itself is removed. Often this means that an allocator need to be kept
//   alive for the remaining lifetime of the program.
// * All virtual methods are marked noexcept, meaning an allocator may never throw exceptions.

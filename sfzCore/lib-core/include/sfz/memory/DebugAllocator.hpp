/// Debug allocator which can be used to debug code using sfzCore Allocators.
///
/// Features:
/// * Keeps track of all allocations made
/// * Checks if an allocation is made with this allocator at deallocation
/// * Checks if an allocation is already deallocated at deallocation
/// * Checks if memory has been written out of bounds before and after allocation
/// * Can be used to check if all memory has been properly deallocated by calling numAllocations()
///   and compare result with expected value (likely 0).
///
/// All internal memory allocations is made with the standard C++ operator new and delete. A
/// DebugAllocator should only be used when debugging, not in release code.

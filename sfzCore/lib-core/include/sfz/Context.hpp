/// is used. All global (singleton) state of sfzCore is stored in this context.
///
/// If using sfzCore with dynamically linked libraries it is necessary to initialize these libraries
/// by sending them a pointer to the context so they themselves can set their sfzCore context to be
/// the same as for the main application. Otherwise multiple contexts will exist, which will likely
/// cause dangerous problems.

	/// functions and classes that uses such. This should be set in the beginning of the program,
	/// remaing valid for the rest of it, and never be replaced in the context. If it is replaced
	/// by another allocator you must make very sure that sfzCore has not allocated any memory using
	/// the previous instance, which can be very hard.

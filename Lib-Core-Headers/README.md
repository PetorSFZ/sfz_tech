# Lib-Core-Headers

A minimal header-only library with no dependencies, essentially the core of [Lib-Core](https://github.com/PetorSFZ/sfz_tech/tree/master/Lib-Core). The reason for this split is that there was a need to use parts of `Lib-Core` for various other projects, but including the entirety of it was too obnoxious. This library is designed to be simple, modular and minimalist while still retaining as much useful features of `Lib-Core` as possible. The design goal is to make it possible to copy just the headers you need right into your project, no build-system necessary.

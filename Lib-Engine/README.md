# Phantasy Engine

Phantasy Engine WAS developed to be a barebones, cross-platform, DIY game engine. This was good education, but that the goal was impractical for a variety of reasons. You should more or less never develop a general purpose game engine, that's bad bang for the buck. Instead, it's way more efficient to develop an engine for a very slim specific purpose (i.e. the specific game you are making). That way you can skip all the stuff you don't need and make the stuff you care about better than what is common.

Currently, the engine is in a bit of a limbo. Code is moved, removed and rewritten all the time to suit its new purpose as the backend for Apocatropics. You should definitely not use Phantasy Engine yourself, unless you plan on completely forking it and continue development on your own.

// Entity
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// An Entity in the ECS system
//
// An entity consists of two components, an ID and a Generation. The ID is central part of the
// entity, it is used to lookup which components are associated with the entity. IDs are reused
// when entities are removed.
//
// The generation is an 8-bit number used to keep track of which generation of a specific ID this
// entity refers to. This is really only used to avoid "dangling pointer entities". Essentially
// the ECS system stores a generation for each possible entity ID. This generation (along with the
// ID) is handed out when a new Entity is created. When an entity is destroyed the ID is returned
// to the pool of free IDs to hand out, but the generation is incremented. By comparing the
// generation of an Entity with the one stored in the ECS system it is possible to check if it is
// the same Entity or if it has been destroyed and the ID reused for another one.
//
// Note that generation 0 is reserved as invalid, meaning an entity with the raw value "0" is
// always considered invalid. For this reason we consider this entity (id 0, gen 0) the "null"
// entity. It is used as an error code or for yet uninitialized entities. Use the constant
// NULL_ENTITY (specified below) for clarity.

// camRealViewMatrix: The view matrix to be used when calculating light matrices. Note that this
//                    is ONLY used for this purpose, i.e. the view matrix does not have to be the
//                    calculated from the camera properties provided. This is useful for debugging
//                    the shadows.
// lightDir: The direction of the light. NOT the direction towards the light.
// shadowHeightDist: The "height" of the shadow map. I.e. how much geometry should be covered from
//                   the view volume to towards the light.
// levelDists: A list with numLevels distances from the camera. Each distance indicates how much
//             area should be covered by each level of the cascaded shadow map. Note that levels
//             will never overlap, so the area for the first level is levelDists[0] - camNear, for
//             second level levelDists[1] - levelDists[0], etc.
